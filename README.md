# MERN-fe-be-app

## I built this app using MongoDB, React, Nodejs and Express.

This is a useful app to add your projects with their tasks. 

You can delete whatever project you want.

You can add tasks for every projects, delete, edit and mark the status of every task.

To use you should create an account and login to start creating your first project.

This is a MERN app, combining FE and BE.
